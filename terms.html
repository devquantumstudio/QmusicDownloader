				<p>
					You are solely responsible for how you use this free tool. You must comply with all applicable laws and any third-party platform terms. Do not use the app to infringe rights or to access or share content you are not
					legally permitted to download.

					own.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Values statement.</em> This project is provided freely as a technical tool. According to our beliefs, using it to obtain music or audio that promotes immorality, hate, atheism, or homosexuality is against God’s law;
					we expressly disown such use—now and in the future (including on the Day of Judgment). Any such use is entirely the user’s choice and responsibility.
				</p>

				<h2 id="ip">3. Intellectual Property</h2>
				<p>
					The app’s interface, code, and design are owned by us or our licensors. Music or audio content downloaded using the app remains the property of its respective rights holders. We do not claim ownership over any downloaded
					files.
				</p>

				<h2 id="thirdparties">4. Third-Party Content &amp; Links</h2>
				<p>The app may link to third-party platforms or websites solely for compatibility and convenience. We do not control or endorse third-party content and are not responsible for their terms or policies.</p>

				<h2 id="disclaimer">6. Disclaimers</h2>
				<p>
					The app is provided <em>“as is”</em> and <em>“as available”</em>, without warranties of any kind (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not
					guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.

					This is a free, community-driven tool provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent allowed by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.
				</p>
				<p>
					If liability cannot be excluded by law, our total aggregate liability will not exceed <strong>USD 0 (zero)</strong>. <strong>Voluntary donations are considered unconditional gifts</strong> and do not create obligations
					or increase our liability in any way.

				<h2 id="termination">8. Termination</h2>
				<p>We may restrict or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or applicable law.</p>

				<h2 id="law">9. Governing Law &amp; Compliance</h2>
				<p>
					We do not designate a specific jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that your use complies with the laws in your location. We make no representation that the app is lawful in any specific region.
				</p>
				<p>If a dispute arises, it must be handled in a court with appropriate jurisdiction where <em>you</em> live or access the app. Your local laws apply, and these Terms do not override any rights you have under those laws.</p>

				<h2 id="changes">10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
				<p>We may update these Terms occasionally. The “Last updated” date reflects the latest version. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
